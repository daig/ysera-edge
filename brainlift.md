# Ysera â€“ Brain Lift

## 1. Purpose
Ysera is a transformative platform designed to streamline scientific research by converting natural language descriptions into actionable API-driven workflows, addressing inefficiencies in the decaying grant system. Key features and objectives include:

- **Natural Language to API Conversion**  
  Translates high-level research descriptions into structured API calls for automation.

- **Generalizable Framework**  
  Builds a scalable system adaptable to various research domains, retrofitting grant processes later.

- **Robust Tool Composition**  
  Leverages multi-step tool calls and structured outputs for reliable execution.

- **Contextual Skip Connections**  
  Enhances decision-making by feeding modulated prior context into later stages.

- **Lightweight Backend Deployment**  
  Utilizes Vercel for efficient, scalable backend operations.

- **Rapid Frontend Development**  
  Employs Vercel V0 for quick, integrated frontend generation with authentication and storage.

- **Operational Detail Extraction**  
  Captures scientists' informal research insights into formalized outputs.

### Scope
- **In Scope**:  
  - Natural language processing for API instrumentation  
  - Multi-step tool call composition  
  - Context modulation with skip connections  
  - Vercel-based backend deployment  
  - Vercel V0 frontend with basic auth/storage  
  - Operational detail formalization from research descriptions  

- **Out of Scope**:  
  - Real-time multi-user collaboration  
  - Extensive cross-domain integrations beyond initial MVP  
  - Heavy reliance on third-party frameworks outside Vercel ecosystem  
  - Subscription-based funding models (to be considered post-MVP)

### Myths
- **"The grant system is sustainable."**  
  It's declining due to funding inefficiencies and institutional bottlenecks, requiring innovative alternatives.  

- **"Start with grants, not tech."**  
  Building from natural language conversion provides a more adaptable foundation than grant-first approaches.  

- **"Simple tool calls suffice."**  
  Complex research workflows require multi-step composition for reliability and thoroughness.  

- **"Context is just input/output."**  
  Modulated skip connections create richer contextual understanding across workflow stages.  

- **"Heavy frameworks are better."**  
  Lightweight Vercel deployment offers superior flexibility and performance for research automation.  

- **"Generic tools beat Vercel V0."**  
  V0's integrated approach delivers more cohesive solutions for research-oriented frontends.  

- **"Scientists formalize easily."**  
  Most researchers prefer natural conversation, requiring specialized tools to extract formal protocols.
